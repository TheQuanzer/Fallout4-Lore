                <p style = "color: white"> The Institute was built upon what was once known as the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or C.I.T.[1] While the college itself laid in ruins for more than two centuries, at the time of the Great War, those present took refuge underground.[1] The Institute was formally founded by the children of the original survivors, who dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated residential facilities and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of infrastructure expansion.[2]

                    Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths as well as help create a new stabilized government, but mutual mistrust and infighting ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation.[3][4] Eventually, the scientists have utterly put ubiquitous pre-War technology to shame,[5] to the point where they believed that wastelanders would be unlikely to understand the sheer scope of the Institute's achievement,[6] such as the creation of the molecular relay (teleporter) in the 2180s,[7] which resulted in the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently,[8] and the development of synths. For decades, the first and second generation synths were the most visible part of the Institute's operations, scavenging for materials and performing experiments on the wasteland. The scientists, sealed away in their utopian society, did not concern themselves with the plight of the surface or the effect their actions had on the surface.[9][10]
                    
                    However, the Institute eventually reached the limits of the synth technology that underpinned their society. Although powerful, the second generation synth was an inherently limited, mechanical platform. To overcome the limitations of metal synthetic materials, the Institute endeavored to create synthetic flesh, with the first research initiative beginning in 2178. Under the auspices of Doctor Frederick, FEV samples served as the starting point for the new, organic synthetic program despite the objections of some members of BioScience.[11] Both women and men were abducted from the Commonwealth and submerged in the Institute's modified FEV, their mutations carefully tracked and extensively investigated. Successful mutations would be monitored to ensure survivability, then tagged and discarded.[12] Research ground to a halt in March 2224, as the research team concluded that the organic synth project could not proceed despite perfecting two FEV strains for the project. Radiation-induced hereditary damage proved too much of an obstacle.[13]
                    
                    The solution came in 2227, with to the acquisition of Shaun by Kellogg and his undamaged pre-War genetic code. The organic synth project was spun off from the FEV research initiative,[14][15] and his DNA became the basis of the third generation synths. The infant Shaun became Father to a whole family of engineered synthetic beings. In 2229, a defective synth caused the Broken Mask Incident, vilifying the Institute in the eyes of the Commonwealth,[16] and causing no small amount of internal problems for the Institute, as he was sent out without proper testing or approval.[17]
                    
                    The FEV research effort continued for several more decades, despite producing no useful data; except for manufacturing more super mutants for the surface to contend with.[18][19] When Brian Virgil succeeded Dr. Syverson as head of the project in April 2286, it became evident that FEV experimentation ran its course and served no useful purpose, not with the availability of third generation synths.[20] The Institute's experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV, ended when Doctor Virgil went rogue and fled into the Commonwealth.[21]
                    
                    But even with the organic synth project complete, the Institute did not rest on its laurels. Work continues in other fields, its sophistication increasing with every day. Of course, with this increase comes an increased appetite for energy; the Institute is constantly facing shortages in its power budget, in no small part due to the fact that the molecular de-materializer (the only way in and out of the facility) requires immense amounts of power for each use.[22] Moreover, despite the luster of the Institute's facilities, a lot of the crucial facilities (particularly the reactor) are pre-War technology and despite continued maintenance requires increasing amounts of resources to keep running after two centuries of expansion.[23] The technology still holds up, as it was built to last.[24]
                    
                    To overcome at least one problem, the ultimate goal of the Institute is energy independence, which they believe can be achieved by restarting the ancient nuclear reactor once used by the C.I.T. to perform experiments and providing the Institute with near limitless power.[25] The design has been revised and the reactor itself extensively upgraded and improved, turning it from a testing reactor into a proper source of electricity.[26] Activating it would free the Institute from the need to compromise and sacrifice,[27] and especially drawing power from above-ground installations.[28] </p>
