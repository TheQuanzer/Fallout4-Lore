                <p style = "color: white"> As of 2287, the East Coast Brotherhood is under the command of Elder Arthur Maxson,[2] the supreme commander of the East Coast Brotherhood of Steel and the last living descendant of the Maxson family line. As the Brotherhood's position in the West declines, the once-moribund Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel has been reformed into a major military force in under a decade, able to project their power and influence all along the Eastern seaboard thanks to the drive and tenacity of its young elder. In 2284, the Brotherhood sent three scout missions into the Commonwealth: first, an unnamed recon squad volunteered to go into the Commonwealth, then Recon Squad Artemis led by Paladin Brandis and Recon Squad Gladius led by Paladin Danse. The first scout team was overwhelmingly successful. They brought back crates full of pre-War technology and documents and the first post-War reconnaissance of the area. Artemis was not so fortunate with their problems beginning at their drop-off point in Malden. Ambushed by Gunners straight off the Vertibird, which resulted in abandoning and manually shorting out their power armor (to prevent the suits from being captured) and the deaths of four knights. The survivors made their way to the National Guard training yard to regroup, which was infested with feral ghouls and resulted in the death of another knight. Brandis and his scribe left to investigate the pre-War Revere satellite array, but super mutants overcame them and claimed the second last member of the team. The only survivor was the commanding officer, Paladin Brandis, who made his way to a pre-War nuclear bunker and took shelter.[8]

                    Three years later, in 2287, Recon Squad Gladius entered the region also looking for technology and valuable documents. They encountered similar resistance from raiders as Artemis did and over the course of several weeks managed to secure a base of operations at the Cambridge Police Station but lost four knights in various confrontations. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, Paladin Danse sent an emergency signal to the Brotherhood, which after several technical delays, responded by sending the Prydwen to the Commonwealth, dominating the skyline while under full vertibird escort. The Brotherhood established a permanent foothold at the Boston Airport and bolstered Gladius' position at the police station. At that point, the Brotherhood began to enforce their ideals upon the Commonwealth and investigate the mysterious energy readings.
                    
                    Several members of the Brotherhood had their own projects to progress within while access to the Institute was researched. Proctor Quinlan required technical documents found in pre-War ruins that might have had information pertaining to important technology, weapon schematics, or military bunkers left behind in the war. Senior Scribe Neriah required blood samples from heavily irradiated species such as feral ghouls, yao guai, and super mutants. Even after Danse is banished from the Brotherhood, Recon Squad Gladius still needed to complete their duties in Cambridge Police Station, such as cataloging tech or cleansing an area of radiation infected beings.
                    
                    In plotting a course to find, access, and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order, determined for the Brotherhood to infiltrate and subsequently attempt to destroy the Institute once and for all.</p>
