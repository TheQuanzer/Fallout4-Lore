    <h1>Cait was born into a distant and abusive family of Irish1 descent in 2261, her parents would routinely physically and verbally abuse her. She attempted to run away twice, the first time she did it, they locked her in a shed outside of the house they lived in. The second time, they broke one of her legs.Cait eventually became convinced she was a mistake, due to the constant abuse, but deluded herself into thinking that they loved her enough not to kick her out of the house. The illusion was shattered once her eighteenth birthday came: They had slapped a shock collar around her neck and sold her into slavery, all without a hint of regret. For the next five years, Cait was used as an entertainment slave for a variety of purposes she refuses to detail. While it wrecked her emotionally and warped her personality, Cait developed significant resentment towards them and eventually learned some tricks of their trade. Stealing caps from sleeping men after they used her, she eventually managed to buy her freedom. With 23 years' worth of pent-up fury, she tracked down her parents and gunned them down in bloody vengeance.</h1>
