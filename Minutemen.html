                <p style = "color: white"> The Commonwealth Minutemen is an all-volunteer civilian militia formed as a result of the efforts by various small communities to protect themselves against the numerous threats present within the Commonwealth. Inspired by the historical Minutemen of the American Revolution, settlers armed and trained themselves and pledged to help defend each other. As the organization expanded, acquiring dividends in both soldiers and resources, they first gained recognition after successfully defending Diamond City from a super mutant attack in 2180.

                    Upon gaining enough resources, the organization eventually assumed control of Fort Independence, transforming it into their main base of operations. Renamed as "The Castle," the group repurposed a large portion of the fort into an armory; in addition, they erected a large radio tower in the courtyard to broadcast the signal for 'Radio Freedom,' a radio station with the purpose of notifying all members of the Minutemen about communities in distress.
                    
                    After operating for a significant amount of time, the Minutemen attempted to establish the 'Commonwealth Provisional Government' by uniting the various settlements of the Commonwealth. These talks ended in the 2230s when an Institute synth infiltrated a meeting and killed all of the settlements' representatives. This event would later be dubbed the CPG Massacre.
                    
                    Later, in 2240, the Minutemen were forced to abandon the fort, due to mirelurk infestation. Thinking it was a super mutant attack, General McGann locked himself deep into the armory behind a myriad of defenses. With this last-ditch effort to protect the armory from being entered, he effectively doomed himself to die by dehydration, a demise hastened by his consuming a fair portion of the bottles in a case of wine. Despite this, his act of defiance prevented the mirelurks from nesting within the armory bastion, preserving it well until the quest Old Guns.
                    
                    The last leader of the Minutemen, General Becker, was killed at some point after his elected appointment as leader. Upon his death, the Minutemen began to experience internal strife, as the various groups couldn't agree upon a successor. The loss of the Castle only exacerbated the problem, and this disagreement on a new leader caused the political landscape to become incredibly fragile. The entire situation came to a head following the Quincy Massacre, many of the militias making up the group disbanding in disgust or turning to banditry, following the almost inevitable loss of popular (and its attendant material) support.
                    
                    Following the whole ordeal, only remnants of the Minutemen and their supporters remained. With the exception of Preston Garvey, one of the few, if not in his words "the last minuteman standing", survivors to escape the massacre thus still loyal to the cause of the organization, the Minutemen had effectively ceased to exist as a cohesive group. </p>
