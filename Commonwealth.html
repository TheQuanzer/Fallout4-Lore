                <p style = "color: white"> A powerful force in the history, industry, and culture of the United States, Massachusetts was one of the original Thirteen Colonies. Massachusetts was often settled by religious colonists in its early days, resulting in sustained growth and rising religious unrest, which included atrocities such as the Salem witch trials of 1692.[1] Massachusetts became a hotbed of secessionist sentiment. The conflict between colonists and the crown was only aggravated by attempts to tax the colonies without giving them representation in the parliament, resulting in the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. The powder keg finally ignited in 1775, when the Thirteen Colonies openly rebelled against the crown during the American Revolutionary War.[2]

                    The battles of Lexington and Concord were the first engagements of the war, which spilled across the colonies. Massachusetts was a vital battleground in the revolution and a major center of American political and spiritual thought. Following the nation's independence and becoming part of the United States, the area grew into an industrial power. Its industry continued to play a prominent role well into the 20th century, though the state began to change midway through the century, after the formation of the 13 Commonwealths in 1969.[3]
                    
                    21st-century America
                    The evolution transformed the face of Massachusetts, with the state's economy supercharged by the emergence of a vibrant high technology sector spearheaded by the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. Located in Cambridge, the CIT was one of the foremost centers of higher learning in the nation, providing it with many great minds, including Robert House, who founded RobCo Industries in 2042, after graduating CIT, and turned it into one of the most profitable companies on the planet within five years.[4]
                    
                    As private and public interests flocked to Massachusetts, the face of the state changed as well. Skyscrapers sprouted across the financial district, with several cutting edge facilities established by many major corporations. A sophisticated network of elevated superhighways and monorail lines are present throughout the city, all of which spanning from the 2040s up until 2077.[5]
                    
                    This mosaic of old and new was host to the several companies and government agencies in the United States, including Mass Fusion (the state's primary energy provider), Vault-Tec Corporation (which also established a number of its vaults across the state), Poseidon Energy, General Atomics International, Galaxy News Network, HalluciGen, Inc., Nuka-Cola Corporation (setting up Nuka-World in the western part of the state) and many more. The ports of Massachusetts continued to bring in commerce and traffic, until the beginning of the Resource Wars and especially the Sino-American War in 2076. Boston shifted easily into its new role, providing the United States Army with technologies to fight communism on all fronts as the country slid towards authoritarianism. Cambridge Polymer Labs developed nanotechnology to further refine the military's weapons. Sentinel Site Prescott to the southwest of the state was erected as defense against nuclear weapons.[6]
                    
                    However, the erosion of civil rights and basic morality did not spare the state or its people. Corporations operated as if unhindered by labor or environmental regulations, especially those with exceptions by the state. The pollution eventually reached such a degree that mutations started to occur in the marine wildlife.[7] Military checkpoints proliferated across the United States, with Massachusetts no exception. The military routinely responded to food riots with violence, including the massacre at the Boston Police rationing site, where the 184th Infantry Regiment gunned down hungry Bostonians with impunity.[8] In spite of the violence, the Boston Bugle continued to distinguish itself as a voice of reason, with dissident journalists continuing to cover the atrocities of the regime regardless of the risk to themselves.[9]
                    
                    Additionally, a number of other military facilities and projects were based in the Commonwealth. The region was used as a major staging point for military aircraft.[10] Fort Strong served as the development ground for the Fat Man portable nuclear launcher and the testing ground for the Army Corps of Engineer's T-51b power armor. Military outposts such as USAF Satellite Station Olivia and the National Guard training yard also dotted the landscape. The Defense Intelligence Agency operated unhindered across the state, operating the Switchboard and a network of hidden caches across the state, while the federal surveillance center K-21B monitored citizens for compliance. The Army, in cooperation with General Atomics, established the covert RB-2851 facility beneath East Boston, where prisoners would be harvested for use in Robobrains.[11]
                    
                    As international tensions flared and the worldwide energy crisis erupted into the Resource Wars, the Commonwealth experienced an even higher military presence as the threat of Chinese infiltration and nuclear war drew closer. Echo Company of the 104th Infantry Regiment was subsequently deployed to man the South Boston military checkpoint, and began conducting mandatory inspections of all vehicles passing through it on August 1, 2077. While the inspections purported to detain "suspicious elements," they discriminated against those of Chinese origin,[12] many of who were already located in Chinese internment camps.[13] Financial reports from this time indicated that increased military spending was coupled with a reduction in healthcare, utilities, and public transportation.[14] Combined with rising energy costs as a result of the Resource Wars, along with hyperinflation and war-weariness gripping the country, especially after the annexation of Canada, public order became a serious issue, especially after images of U.S. atrocities were made public. Lieutenant Governor Graham eventually placed Boston under martial law,[14] while American units serving in China and on the Anchorage Front Line found themselves pulled back to deal with domestic unrest at home.
                    
                    Few survived the blast, besides those who were able to gain entry to the various vaults and bomb shelters located in Boston and the surrounding area. As Boston itself was not targeted directly, much of the city survived the initial bombardment relatively intact, including such locations as the Massachusetts State House, Boston Common and Fenway Park. The military attempted to maintain order in the aftermath, utilizing power armor to help quell unrest and transmitting emergency frequency RJ1138 over the airwaves to other Commonwealth Army soldiers promising food, shelter, and aid at the South Boston military checkpoint. With its command structure in tatters, however, the military eventually disbanded. The heads of various government sectors presumably survived the blast, at least initially, including the mayor of Boston who holed himself up at the Boston mayoral shelter. When the shelter was besieged by an angry mob, the mayor and his family perished.[15] Ultimately, dwindling supplies, disrupted communication networks and the lack of a clear leadership structure prevented any form of organized government from reasserting control in the Commonwealth.
                    
                    The Great War
                    On October 23, 2077, the day of the Great War, the nuclear conflagration that lasted only two hours plunged the nation into chaos. Following nuclear strikes on Pennsylvania and New York at 9:42 am, a nuclear missile hit a designated site southwest of Boston at 9:47 am, with another missile simultaneously striking the Washington, D.C. area.[16] The Commonwealth's ground zero held industrial and military significance, housing arms factories and manufacturing plants,[17] including the Sentinel site. Additionally, the Chinese Yangtze-31 submarine, which infiltrated the bay and bypassed missile defense systems, fired two of its total six strategic nuclear SLBMs at the U.S. eastern seaboard. Before firing the other four SLBMs, the submarine was damaged by an underwater mine and was forced to seek shelter in Boston's harbor. The remaining four SLBMs had remained in the submarine, three of which were still operational and one had gotten stuck within its' firing pod, presumably during the launch of the two SLBMs that had launched. Despite the success of the Chinese attack, the 132nd Engineering Corps stationed at Sentinel site Prescott was still able to retaliate by firing their own nuclear stockpile before the Chinese missiles hit[18] due to early warnings via radar.
                    
                    Following total nuclear annihilation, most of the Commonwealth was reduced to a "war-ravaged quagmire of violence and despair."[19] The brief bombardment spared most of the city, with military units stationed in and around the city struggling to maintain order. To the southwest, the Glowing Sea was born in the nuclear fire, with the aforementioned nuke in the megaton range detonating northwest of the sentinel site, turning a vast stretch of land into a radioactive hellscape that would persist for centuries, bolstered by the destroyed nuclear reactors seeping fuel into the atmosphere and the ground. Harsh crackdowns by the military only contributed to the chaos, with any semblance of order eventually collapsing in on itself.[20]
                    
                    Post-War
                    The Commonwealth Institute of Technology was irreparably damaged. The staff had trouble surviving the conflagration, with the science staff taking refuge underground, slowly carving out subterranean habitat for themselves. The Institute was formally founded in 2110, as the children of the original survivors dug into the earth and built increasingly sophisticated habitats and laboratories, starting an ongoing process of expanding the Institute's facilities and infrastructure.[21] Isolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths, but mutual mistrust ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation.[22]
                    
                    The key element of the future Commonwealth was founded at the ruins of Fenway Park stadium in the mid-2130s,[23] when Diamond City was established. The settlement greatly benefited from its central location and the natural protection afforded by the baseball stadium, gradually rising to the position of the "Great, Green Jewel of the Commonwealth" and becoming an integral part of the region's history and its many factions. It also became the site of many of the region's miseries, such as when the Commonwealth Provisional Government, the first and only attempt to form a unified government for the Commonwealth, was wiped out by a synth from the Institute. Whether it was deliberate sabotage or a play made by one of the factions within the Institute, the loss of the CPG doomed any future attempts at organizing a government, and led to the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently after developing the molecular relay in the 2180s,[24][25]
                    
                    The Minutemen came closest to becoming an organized army protecting the Commonwealth, rising to prominence after defending Diamond City from a super mutant attack in 2180 - the mutants being the first experiments released by the Institute into the wild as part of their research into organic synths.[26] Their rising star was snuffed out in the middle of the 23rd century, after the loss of the Castle to mirelurks in 2240, after a queen mirelurk decided she fancied the location.[27][28] The loss of their headquarters, radio station and General McGann sent the Commonwealth Minutemen into disarray. Without artillery support and their resources, they were picked off one by one.[29][30] The formation of Goodneighbor by exiled individuals from Diamond City that same year also signaled a shift in the Commonwealth. The Broken Mask incident of 2229 and the revelation of third generation synths to the general population established the Institute as a bogeyman and contributed to the mutual distrust and paranoia that kept the communities of the Commonwealth divided.[31][32]
                    
                    Since then the situation has remained tenuous. The Institute continued to experiment on the surface and use it as a source of raw materials for the expansion of its underground habitats, raiders and Gunners preyed on the people of the wasteland, too numerous to be killed off, but too disorganized to take the Commonwealth over, while the Minutemen atrophied. The Railroad conducted a guerrilla war against the Institute, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of the Institute's pursuit. However, the fertile soils of the region, its technological legacy and the ready availability of salvage meant that region remained a crucial source of trade and resources. Tobar has once included it in his trading circuit,[33] while caravans from the north, south, and west continue to pass through the region, contributing to the wealth of Bunker Hill and especially Diamond City. An additional upheaval came in 2287 when the War of the Commonwealth started with the arrival of the Brotherhood of Steel, subsequently setting its sights on the Institute and the technology within.</p>
